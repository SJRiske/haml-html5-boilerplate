HAML HTML5 Boilerplate
======================

### A leaner HAML HTML5 boilerplate for "mobile first" responsive web design

Whilst HTML5 boilerplates are great tools, they can often in the wrong hands result in over bloated HTML5. Ditch the excess boilerplate markup that's there "just in case" and adopt leaner "mobile first" responsive web design.

By utilising HAML comments, this boilerplate still includes the kitchen sink "just in case", however, all but the most essentials have been commented out. As a result, this boilerplate compiles to just:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class="no-js" lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
    <meta content="" name="description">
    <meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" name="viewport">
    <link href="/favicon.ico" rel="shortcut icon">
    <link href="/css/base.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

That should be enough to get started. If you need anything else, just uncomment and compile.
